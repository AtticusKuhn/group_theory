# Group Theory

In order to advance my understanding of group theory,
I am writing down and proving the first couple of chapters of Dummit and Foote's "Abstract Algebra"
textbook in the automated theorem prover Lean.

So far, here are all the things I have formalized
 - the definition of a group
 - the defintiion of an abelian group
 - propositions about groups, e.g. for all a, -(-a) = a
 - proof that integers under additon are a group
- proof that rationals under addition are a group
- proof that the dihedral group is a group
- proof that the symmetric group is a group
 - defintion of a homomorphism
  - definition of an isomorphism

I welcome all pull requests.
